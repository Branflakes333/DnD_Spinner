This project is part learning project, part passion project.

### Background

I am a fan of Dungeons & Dragons (DnD / D&D), and like creating characters. I have a specific interest in Druids. 
This will explain the choice of probabiliteis used in the spinner. 

### Goals

1. Get a working layered RNG script with fixed probabilites.
2. Get a working layered RNG script with input parameters.
3. Get a working spinner application.
4. Get a working character creator implemented (Whole other project if I even get this far)

### Generative AI

While I am doing this project for learning, I'm also doing it for fun, and to actually use. 
I am strictly using ChatGPT for coding theory.
I am also using Copilot to streamline the setup stage of this project. 
As I progress through the project, I am utilizing Copilot less and less.
While "test_spinner.py" was initially coded be Copilot, 
I intend to code the rest and future testers using Claude, or not genAI.
